# Two-Axis Sorting Station - Factory I/O

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an automated industrial sorting system using a **Two-Axis Pick & Place** station. The system identifies and sorts items based on specific criteria, simulating a real-world warehouse automation workflow.

## Technical Stack
* **PLC:** Siemens S7-1200
* **Programming Software:** TIA Portal (v17 or higher)
* **Simulation:** Factory I/O
* **Logic Type:** Ladder Logic (LAD)

## Features
* Precision X and Z axis motion control.
* Automated part detection and picking sequence.
* Seamless integration between TIA Portal and Factory I/O.

## How to Run
1. Open the `.ap17` (or `.zap`) file in **TIA Portal**.
2. Start the PLCSIM.
3. Open the **Factory I/O** scene provided in this folder.
4. Set the Driver to `Siemens S7-PLCSIM` and connect.
5. Switch the PLC to RUN mode and enjoy the simulation!
